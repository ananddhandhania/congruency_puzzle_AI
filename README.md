congruency_puzzle_AI
====================

A gui implementation of a puzzle to find six congruent parts in an un-ordered set of tiles. The gui was implemented in ktinker and the Depth First Search algorithm was implemented in C++ to solve the puzzle. It seems that depth first search is one of the most straight forward method to implement this puzzle.
